### Colour Scheme 

![Friendcurate Palette](static/images/Friendcurate-palette.png)

The colour scheme for Friendcurate was selected from an image of a charcoal sketch, as it was fitting for the site's palette as a social network and image hosting site primarily aimed at artists with sufficient contrast. Also, the grey shades were selected to allow the user-uploaded images to pop out in the gallery.
