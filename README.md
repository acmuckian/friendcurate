## Features 

### Home Page 

The front page displays a gallery of art uploaded by users of the website, immediately demonstrating to the user the point of the website, which is a network for artists to share their artwork. Curious visitors can click on the artworks to see more information. 



When a visitor is not logged in and sees the website, there is a call to action inviting the visitor to join the website.

## UX 

### Colour Scheme 

![Friendcurate Palette](static/images/Friendcurate-palette.png)

The colour scheme for Friendcurate was selected from an image of a charcoal sketch, as it was fitting for the site's palette as a social network and image hosting site primarily aimed at artists with sufficient contrast. Also, the grey shades were selected to allow the user-uploaded images to pop out in the gallery. 

### Typography 

The Friendcurate logo is in the ![Rubik 80s Fade](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik+80s+Fade) font. The main header font for the main headers is ![Cabin Sketch](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin+Sketch) - to reflect the art element of the website. Some of the headings use the ![Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P) to give a cool, retro feel to the website and accompanies the Rubik 80s Fade font.
